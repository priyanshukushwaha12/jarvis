👶 Stage 1: Script Kiddie (Newbie Level)

💡 Definition: Someone who uses tools without understanding how they work. Nothing wrong with starting here — we all do.

What to do in this phase:

    🌐 Understand how the internet works

    Learn IP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, TCP/IP, Ports
    Tools: Wireshark, Ping, Traceroute

    🖥️ Basic OS & Networking Skills

    Learn Linux (Kali Linux, ParrotOS)
    Command line basics: cd, ls, grep, chmod, nmap, curl

    💣 Play with Tools (Understand, Don’t Just Use)

    Nmap (Network Scanning)
    Burp Suite (Web Proxy)
    Metasploit (Exploitation Framework)
    John the Ripper, Hydra (Password Cracking)

    📚 Learn Basic Programming

    Python (for scripting, automation, payloads)
    Bash (for Linux)
    HTML/JS/PHP (for web hacking)

🔥 Tip: Stop blindly copying YouTube payloads. Start reading the documentation.
🧪 Stage 2: Beginner Hacker (Learning + Labs)

You’re now learning how vulnerabilities work — not just how to run tools.

Skills to Focus On:

    ✅ Networking (Advanced)

    Subnetting, NAT, VPN, VLAN, Firewall basics

    ✅ Operating Systems Internals

    Windows architecture, Registry, PowerShell
    Linux file systems, crons, services

    ✅ Web Hacking Fundamentals

    OWASP Top 10: SQLi, XSS, IDOR, CSRF, SSRF, RCE
    Tools: Burp Suite Pro, SQLMap, XSStrike

    ✅ Practice Platforms:

    Hack The Box
    TryHackMe
    VulnHub
    PortSwigger Labs
    Web Security Academy

🎯 Don’t just solve machines — take notes, learn how they worked, recreate the attack.
🔐 Stage 3: Intermediate — Cybersecurity Analyst / Bug Bounty Hunter

You can now analyze attacks, write simple scripts, and maybe even get your first bounty.

Key Paths:

    Red Teaming (Attacking)

    Exploitation, Social Engineering, Pivoting, Lateral Movement
    Learn Privilege Escalation (Linux/Windows)
    Learn Active Directory, NTLM, Kerberos
    Tools: BloodHound, Impacket, Mimikatz, CrackMapExec

    Blue Teaming (Defending)

    SIEM (Splunk, ELK), IDS/IPS (Snort, Suricata)
    Incident Response, Threat Hunting
    Malware Analysis, Forensics

    Bug Bounties / Web Hacking

    Platforms: HackerOne, BugCrowd, Synack
    Automation with tools like ffuf, dirsearch, nuclei, gf, httprobe

    Skills to Learn:

    Batch Scripting, VBS Scripting, C# Executable, PowerShell scripting
    Web Exploits deeply: CSP Bypass, CORS Misconfig, JWT Attacks
    Understanding CVEs and writing your own exploits

🧠 Stage 4: Advanced — Penetration Tester / Red Teamer / Specialist

This is where you enter the professional arena. Time to get certified and specialize.
🎓 Must-Have Certifications (Pick based on path):

    For Red Team / Offensive Security:

    ✅ eJPT (INE — Great for beginners)
    ✅ OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) — Industry Respect
    ✅ CRTP / CRTE (for Active Directory)
    ✅ CEH (Overhyped but HR-friendly)
    ✅ PNPT (Practical Networking Pen Test by TCM Security)
    ✅ CRTO (Red Team Ops)

    For Blue Team / Defensive:

    ✅ CompTIA Security+
    ✅ CySA+
    ✅ GCIA / GCIH
    ✅ CHFI (Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator)

    For Bug Bounties / Web App Testing:

    ✅ Burp Suite Certified
    ✅ Web Security Academy Advanced Labs

💸 Pro Tip: Don’t go broke chasing certs. Learn first, then certify when needed.

🛡️ Defense:

    Splunk
    Sysmon
    Volatility (Memory Forensics)
    Ghidra / IDA (Reverse Engineering)

⚙️ Essential Soft Skills (Don’t skip these)

✍️ Documentation — write reports clearly, explain your steps.

💬 Communication — present findings to devs, managers.

⚖️ Legal Awareness — know what’s legal hacking (engagement rules, bug bounty terms).

🤔 Problem Solving — every box is a puzzle, every network is unique.
🔁 Never Stop the Cycle

Cybersecurity is constantly evolving. New exploits, new CVEs, new defenses.

    📢 Follow researchers on Twitter/X, Reddit (r/netsec, r/HowToHack)

    📰 Read CVEs, exploit-db, HackTricks

    📺 Watch Live Hacking Events (LiveOverflow, Stök, The Cyber Mentor, InsiderPhD)

    🛠️ Build your own labs, projects, scripts

👑 Final Stage: Elite Hacker (Cyber Jedi)

You’re writing your own tools, creating exploits, speaking at conferences, maybe even catching APTs or breaking into hardened networks during authorized engagements.

At this stage, you:

    Know 3–4 programming languages

    Understand exploit development (buffer overflows, ROP chains, shellcode crafting)

    Contribute to open-source tools or publish papers

    Maybe even lead teams or train others

💥 Real-World Advice to Keep in Mind:

✅ Don’t rush it — this is a craft, not a course.

✅ Don’t rely on tools — be the tool.

✅ Always ask “why does this work?” — not just “how”.

✅ Learn to fail fast and learn faster.

✅ Stay legal, stay ethical, stay curious.
